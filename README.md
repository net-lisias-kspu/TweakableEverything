Ever wanted to open a shielded docking port in the editor, or start your ship with crossfeed disabled across your docking ports? Maybe adjust the ejection force of your decouplers, or open a solar panel? The poorly-named TweakableEverything exists to provide exactly such features. Shielded and lateral docking ports can be opened in the editor and fitted with other stackable parts. Decoupler ejection force can be tweaked, and solar panels can be opened in the editor. These options and more leverage the new Tweakables system for your fun and profitÃ‚Â¹.

TweakableEverything is so named not because it makes everything tweakable (that would be ludicrous), but because it is Everything that I have made Tweakable. But, since you might not want all of it, I have broken things out into separate libraries. If, for example, you don't want TweakableSolarPanels, just delete TweakableSolarPanels.dll and TweakableSolarPanels.cfg from your TweakableEverything folder. I won't be offended -- promise!
